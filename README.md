## Covid's Ark Dashboard

Covid's Ark Dashboard is a Dashboard that builted for my Master's Thesis entitled: "Covid-19 Data Management at Global Scale with a Focus on the Biomedical Sector: Construction of the 'Covid's Ark' Database and Development of a corresponding Web Application".
From the above centence, maybe have been created some questionmarks. So let's go to explain it in a simple and brief way.
First of all, 'Covid's Ark' is a Database which contains about 1000 tables of Covid-19 Data from the beginning of the pandemic till today with a focus οn Βiomedical sector. This Database aimed to collect and store a wide variety of data based on type and format, 
relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic, in a structured format (as tables). The data retreived from 174 primary and secondary Covid-19 Databases, taking into account all legal constraints. 
So, in order to share these data with an interactive way, it was deemed necessary to make a Dashboard. For its construction, was used the programming language R (version 4.3.2) and the technology of RShiny.
Then, the whole dashboard published in shinyapps.io.
